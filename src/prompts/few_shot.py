Under Connecticut landlord-tenant law (CGS §47a-1 et seq.), valid residential leases must contain:

1. Essential Elements:
   - Identification of premises (street address and unit number)
   - Duration of tenancy (fixed term or month-to-month)
   - Rent amount and due date (CGS §47a-3a)
   - Security deposit terms (must follow §47a-21 limits)

2.  Mandatory Disclosures :
   - Lead paint notification (for pre-1978 housing)
   - Security deposit receipt with bank information (§47a-21(c))
   - Notice of basement flooding history (§47a-7b)

3.  Prohibited Clauses :
   - Waiver of implied warranty of habitability (CGS §47a-4a)
   - Automatic confession of judgment provisions
   - Unreasonable liquidated damages

 Enforcement Considerations :
- Oral leases are valid for terms <1 year but provide less protection
- Must provide copy of signed lease within 30 days (§47a-7a)
- Illegal provisions are void but don't necessarily invalidate entire lease
